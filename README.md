# Phase2Project_PokeTeamBulder

## Setup

All the Pokemon information about can be found in the `db.json` file. We'll
be using `json-server` to create a RESTful API for our database.

Run `npm install` to install our dependencies.

Then, run `npm run server` to start up `json-server` on `http://localhost:3001`.

In another tab, run `npm start` to start up our React app at `http://localhost:3000`.
